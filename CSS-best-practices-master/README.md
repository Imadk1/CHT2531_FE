# CSS Best Practices

* Download and unzip this repository (click the big green button)
* Open the HTML and CSS in a text editor
* Don't make any changes to the HTML
* Add CSS rules that will do the following:
    1. Make the *div* with an id of 'news4' fit the styling of the other news posts. It will need to be floated to the right like the second news item, and appear beneath the third news item.
    2. Give the footer a red background, margin of 10px, padding of 20px and a solid rounded border (10px radius).
    3. Change the colour of the hyperlink in the footer so it is visible (white).
* How DRY do you think the CSS is? Specifically what do you think the problems are? 
* How could the CSS and HTML be re-written to avoid these problems?
